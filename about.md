I am a mechanical engineering student from National Technical University of
Athens (NTUA). My fields of interest include graphSLAM, multi-robot SLAM,
Control Theory and Computer Simulations.

- In 2012 I participated in a summer course where we developed the source code
    for controlling a DRK8080 robot using the C# language.
- In 2013 I developed a cross-platform GUI for controlling a
    Cavro XP3000 digital pump using Qt.
- For the 1st semester of 2015 I studied as an Erasmus student in the
    Royal Instutute of Technology of Sweden (KTH), where I concentrated in
    Control theory and Aeronautics-related subjects
- Since the summer of 2015 I undertook my master thesis in the field of
    multi-robot robotics under Proffessor 
    [Kostas J.  Kyriakopoulos](http://www.controlsystemslab.gr/kkyria/).
    Subject of the thesis was the "Investigation, design and implementation of
    single and multi-robot SLAM algorithms"

    + The single-robot algorithms along with a novel
        loop-closing scheme were implemented as part of my Google Summer of Code (GSoC)
        internship of 2017 for the *Mobile Robot Programming Toolkit* [MRPT](http://www.mrpt.org).
