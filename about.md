[Curriculum Vitae](/res/cv.pdf)

I am a Robotics/SLAM engineer enthusiastic about new technologies, computers and
programming. I love . In my free time I'm tinkering with electronics, learn
new programming concepts or contribute to the open-source
[MRPT](https://mrpt.org) framework.

I hold a Master's Degree from the national [Technical University of Athens
(NTUA)](http://www.mech.ntua.gr/en/). My master thesis was in the field of
multi-robot SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping) under the super vision
of Professor [Kostas J.
Kyriakopoulos](http://www.controlsystemslab.gr/kkyria/). Subject of the thesis
was the "Investigation, design and implementation of single and multi-robot SLAM
algorithms"
