[Curriculum Vitae](/res/cv.pdf)

I am a Robotics/SLAM engineer, enthusiastic about new technologies, computers
and programming. I love coding, travelling, bouldering and lately discovering
new funky cafes and restaurants in London. In my free time I'm tinkering with
electronics, learning new programming concepts or contribute to the open-source
[MRPT](https://mrpt.org) robotics framework.

I hold a Master's Degree from the national [Technical University of Athens
(NTUA)](http://www.mech.ntua.gr/en/). My master thesis was in the field of
multi-robot SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping) under the super vision
of Professor [Kostas J.
Kyriakopoulos](http://www.controlsystemslab.gr/kkyria/). Subject of the thesis
was the "Investigation, design and implementation of single and multi-robot SLAM
algorithms"
