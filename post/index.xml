Read the first part here
This post outlines 5 common issues that I had been facing during my day-to-day development and the solutions that I came up with via 5 Albert plugins respectively.
TL;DR The purpose of these plugins is a) to avoid context-switching and b) have a single tool with a single interface instead X different tools with their own corresponding interfaces.</description></item><item><title>A Mind Map of Mental Models</title><link>https://bergercookie.dev/post/mental-models/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Dec 2020 17:29:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bergercookie.dev/post/mental-models/</guid><description>Behavioral psychology and the works of Kanheman and Tversky has been a hobby of mine for quite some time now. Same goes for podcasts like Freakonomics and Choiceology. Given that, it&amp;rsquo;s only natural to come across the Farmam Street blog by Shane Parish and more specifically, the article on Mental Models.
Mental models are heuristics that simplify reality and help you navigate the world around you. For example they may help you make better decisions, explain other people&amp;rsquo;s actions, close deals at work or study more efficiently for an exam.</description></item><item><title>Cracking the OpenCV Applications Course - Project 1</title><link>https://bergercookie.dev/post/opencv-project1/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bergercookie.dev/post/opencv-project1/</guid><description>This is a writeup of my first assignment for the &amp;ldquo;Computer Vision II: Applications&amp;rdquo; course.

These are the Linux Kernel in a Nutshell, and LINUX Core Kernel Commentary.
These books are rather old, so some bits are outdated, but don&amp;rsquo;t let this fact discourage you. Both can be super useful and can definitely help you learn more about how the Kernel works.
Linux Kernel In a Nutshell The first one is a classic.</description></item><item><title>Scratchpad - Create multi-ISO USBs with Easy2boot</title><link>https://bergercookie.dev/post/easy2boot/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Mar 2020 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bergercookie.dev/post/easy2boot/</guid><description>Easy2boot is a utility that allows you to flash a USB with multiple bootable images. This gives you the option of always carrying a variety of OSes / tools for all sorts of different scenarios (debugging using a Rescue image / gparted live, install Ubuntu / Windows 10 etc. images)
Here are the contents of a E2B USB stick that I tend to carry with me and use on a regular basis.</description></item><item><title>Scratchpad - LSD - A colorful ls alternative</title><link>https://bergercookie.dev/post/lsd/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Mar 2020 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bergercookie.dev/post/lsd/</guid><description>Intro lsd is an alternative to the classic ls UNIX tool. It shows you a listing of files, directories, links, named pipes etc. The difference to its predecessor is that it makes use of Glyph-rich fonts such as Nerd Fonts as well as an abundance of colors preconfigured and available from start.

Most probably not all of these bullets are going to be useful in your case, but I hope that at there will be at least a 10% of them which you won&amp;rsquo;t have come across before or that you&amp;rsquo;ll find useful and add to your arsenal.

For those of you that don&amp;rsquo;t know it, Albert is an application launcher for Linux. It&amp;rsquo;s written in C++ and its GUI is built on top of Qt. The current post is a short summary of the plugins I&amp;rsquo;ve implemented to automate parts of my current routine and maximise my productivity along with advise and, hopefully, useful information on how to do the same for your needs via Albert.</description></item><item><title>üõ†Ô∏è Scratchpad - CV Applications II Course by OpenCV</title><link>https://bergercookie.dev/post/opencv-applications-ii/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bergercookie.dev/post/opencv-applications-ii/</guid><description>Computer Vision Applications using OpenCV Facial Landmark Detection Improve the speed of Facial Landmark Detection: Use face detection that comes with OS - if possible (e.g., Android, iOS) Skip frames - e.g,. run every 3 frames Downscale image, detect faces there &amp;hellip; then propagate bboxes to original image (dividing the coordinates by the scale used for resizing the original frame.).

More specifically I want to describe my workflow when working or in general when using my machine.
My general goal is to be productive in my day-to-day routine, and automate everything that can actually be automated so that I can focus on the higher-level tasks I&amp;rsquo;m interested in. I admit that sometimes I&amp;rsquo;m overdoing it and automate a task that I don&amp;rsquo;t actually have to but all in all I think this attitude has helped me considerably so far.</description></item><item><title>Hello world!</title><link>https://bergercookie.dev/post/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Apr 2017 15:10:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bergercookie.dev/post/hello-world/</guid><description>Hey people, this is the first post in my attempt of a proper Jekyll blog.
