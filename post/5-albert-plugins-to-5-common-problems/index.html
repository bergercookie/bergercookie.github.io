You may either haven’t used these tools at all, or are not able to recall the exact flags for the task at hand. Two common ways of dealing with this are:\n Google it! You’ll then most probably want to move to a stackoverflow answer, copy-paste a command that seems to solve your issue, and then adjust it accordingly. This involves a few browser redirections (at least google.com - stackoverflow.com), as well as the overhead of selecting the right post and finding the right answer to your question. Read the manpage / help page of the tool, if it has one. This resource may be more rigorous but it will also take more time to find the documentation section that you’re interested in.  A more effective approach to this would be to use a software such as tldr, bro pages, or cheat. More specifically, tldr allows you to look up the most common usecases for a wide variety of tools, all without leaving your command line. It’s also easily extensible, allowing you to add more examples to specific tools, or adding documentation and examples for new tools.\nHowever even in this case you have to switch context from what you’re currently doing; If you’re working e.g., on VS Code, you have to start a new terminal, look up the tool that you want, copy the usecase that you’re interested in, paste and modify it accordingly. We can do better than that.\nEnter the tldr_pages albert plugin\nIt allows you to do fuzzy autocompletion-enabled search on any tldr command and copy its content on ENTER. In addition you can also quickly navigate to the appropriate webpage if you want to read more about the tool at hand, or fall back to a google search if that’s not good enough.\n📓 Taking notes instantly - Refactor later Whether I’m either reading articles on Wikipedia, watching videos on YouTube, or doing pretty much anything on the computer that involves a bit of learning, I like to take notes. A good approach to this would be to split your screen vertically and have the browser on one side and your favorite editor on the other. Then you would create a new text file for every new item you ’re studying, add a title, then add your notes or copy paste accordingly.\nThis involves a few steps in the process that can be improved:\n  At that particular moment I don’t want to have to:\n create a new file think of where to place it in my hierarchy of notes add the appropriate title add structure to the note that I’m taking  I’d rather spend this time just recording my thoughts and reading through the actual Wikipedia page.\n  I don’t want to switch between reading the resource and recording my notes.\n  To deal with this, I’m using a very simple plugin called scratchpad.\nIts logic is super simple. You write some text to it and it writes it to a file; The same file all the time. You specify the path to that file the first time you trigger the plugin.\nEach text is saved there and by default it’s formatted with a maximum width of 80 characters to assist in later potential reformatting. A blank line is inserted between successive entries to the file and it allows to add a separator if you start adding notes about a new subject\nThe plugin gets triggered either explicitly using s or automatically if your Albert query is longer than 5 words. This process allows you to record anything you want and then sort them out later (i.e., place them into separate files, structure them better, etc.).\nHere’s how your scratchpad looks like after a bunch of additions from two different pages:\n🔗 Adding Links during Text Editing Another common issue is inserting links to other pages or documentation while you’re creating or editing an existing page. That may be a markdown document for your GitHub repo, a Confluence page or Jira issue in your day job or a report you’re righting in LibreOffice. Most times you’d have to stop what you’re doing, launch your browser, search on google the thing you’re interested in and navigate to it, and finally, copy the link displayed in your browser prompt\nAgain, as with the previous issues discussed this approach takes too much time and makes you context switch from the thing you’re currently doing.\nInstead use googler or even better one of the many googler-enabled plugins in the awesome-albert-plugins repo. You can basically use the create_googler_plugins.py script after you’ve downloaded the repository to several Albert plugins, each one responsible for searching in a single website. So for example, you can use the trigger gg to search and get results for Google, or gh to search on GitHub or imdb to search on IMDB.\nHere’s how it looks:\n| | | | | |\nUsing one of these plugins, for example the one that searches on Google, you can search for and copy the link to the resource you’re interested in without leaving the document you’re currently editing.\n🈯 Translating Text Again, same premise as in the previous cases. You’re reading an article or watching a movie and you don’t know a word or a phrase written there. It’s too much of a hassle to open a new browser tab, go to Google Translate to do the translation.\nUse the google_translate plugin in conjunction with the word plugin.\n| | |\nThe google_translate plugin will translate the word from the source language to the destination language while you can also use the auto source to enable autodetection.\nThe word plugin on the other hand will give you the definition of the given word along with synonyms and antonyms.\n🎷 Playing Radio Streams This last plugin allows you to play and alternate between different stations easily and without jumping around different webpages to do so.\nIt’s called saxophone, and this is how its interface looks.\nThere’s a bunch of preconfigured radios, specified in the config/saxophone.json file. You can easily extend that list to include your preferences as well.\nUnder the hood it uses the VLC Remote-Control Interface.\n","wordCount":"1177","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://bergercookie.dev/images/albert-demos/example.png","datePublished":"2021-05-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2021-05-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"bergercookie"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://bergercookie.dev/post/5-albert-plugins-to-5-common-problems/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Bergercookie's Thoughtstream","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://bergercookie.dev/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://bergercookie.dev accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://bergercookie.dev/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://bergercookie.dev/about/ title=~about><span>~about</span></a></li><li><a href=https://bergercookie.dev/post/ title=posts><span>posts</span></a></li><li><a href=https://bergercookie.dev/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://bergercookie.dev/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://bergercookie.dev/photography/ title=photography><span>photography</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li><li><a href=https://bergercookie.dev/search/ title="🔍 (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>🔍</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://bergercookie.dev>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://bergercookie.dev/post/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>5 Albert Plugins to 5 Workflow Issues</h1><div class=post-meta><span title="2021-05-01 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">May 1, 2021</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;bergercookie&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/bergercookie/bergercookie.github.io/blob/src/content//post/5-albert-plugins-to-5-common-problems.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><figure class=entry-cover><a href=https://bergercookie.dev/images/albert-demos/example.png target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading=lazy src=https://bergercookie.dev/images/albert-demos/example.png alt="Using Albert to boost your productivity"></a><p>An image of the search plugins using <code>googler</code></p></figure><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=#tldr aria-label=TL;DR>TL;DR</a></li><li><a href=#-looking-up-command--tool-usage-instructions aria-label="🔎 Looking up command / tool usage instructions">🔎 Looking up command / tool usage instructions</a></li><li><a href=#-taking-notes-instantly---refactor-later aria-label="📓 Taking notes instantly - Refactor later">📓 Taking notes instantly - Refactor later</a></li><li><a href=#-adding-links-during-text-editing aria-label="🔗 Adding Links during Text Editing">🔗 Adding Links during Text Editing</a></li><li><a href=#-translating-text aria-label="🈯 Translating Text">🈯 Translating Text</a></li><li><a href=#-playing-radio-streams aria-label="🎷 Playing Radio Streams">🎷 Playing Radio Streams</a></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>This is part two of my articles on the Albert launcher.
