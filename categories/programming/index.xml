Read the first part here
This post outlines 5 common issues that I had been facing during my day-to-day development and the solutions that I came up with via 5 Albert plugins respectively.
TL;DR The purpose of these plugins is a) to avoid context-switching and b) have a single tool with a single interface instead X different tools with their own corresponding interfaces.</description></item><item><title>Scratchpad - Create multi-ISO USBs with Easy2boot</title><link>https://bergercookie.dev/post/easy2boot/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Mar 2020 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bergercookie.dev/post/easy2boot/</guid><description>Easy2boot is a utility that allows you to flash a USB with multiple bootable images. This gives you the option of always carrying a variety of OSes / tools for all sorts of different scenarios (debugging using a Rescue image / gparted live, install Ubuntu / Windows 10 etc. images)
Here are the contents of a E2B USB stick that I tend to carry with me and use on a regular basis.</description></item><item><title>Scratchpad - LSD - A colorful ls alternative</title><link>https://bergercookie.dev/post/lsd/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Mar 2020 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bergercookie.dev/post/lsd/</guid><description>Intro lsd is an alternative to the classic ls UNIX tool. It shows you a listing of files, directories, links, named pipes etc. The difference to its predecessor is that it makes use of Glyph-rich fonts such as Nerd Fonts as well as an abundance of colors preconfigured and available from start.

For those of you that don&amp;rsquo;t know it, Albert is an application launcher for Linux. It&amp;rsquo;s written in C++ and its GUI is built on top of Qt. The current post is a short summary of the plugins I&amp;rsquo;ve implemented to automate parts of my current routine and maximise my productivity along with advise and, hopefully, useful information on how to do the same for your needs via Albert.</description></item><item><title>üõ†Ô∏è Scratchpad - CV Applications II Course by OpenCV</title><link>https://bergercookie.dev/post/opencv-applications-ii/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bergercookie.dev/post/opencv-applications-ii/</guid><description>Computer Vision Applications using OpenCV Facial Landmark Detection Improve the speed of Facial Landmark Detection: Use face detection that comes with OS - if possible (e.g., Android, iOS) Skip frames - e.g,. run every 3 frames Downscale image, detect faces there &amp;hellip; then propagate bboxes to original image (dividing the coordinates by the scale used for resizing the original frame.).

More specifically I want to describe my workflow when working or in general when using my machine.
My general goal is to be productive in my day-to-day routine, and automate everything that can actually be automated so that I can focus on the higher-level tasks I&amp;rsquo;m interested in. I admit that sometimes I&amp;rsquo;m overdoing it and automate a task that I don&amp;rsquo;t actually have to but all in all I think this attitude has helped me considerably so far.</description></item></channel></rss>
