As this is my first actual post I thought I'd write about something I'm a big
fun of, tooling. More specifically I want to describe my workflow when working
or in general when using my machine. Here's a bullet list of the software I'm
using:

- **OS:** GNU/Linux
- **Linux flavour:** Ubuntu/Debian
- **Desktop Environment:** i3
- **Browser:** Firefox
- **Editor:** Neovim
- **Terminal Emulator:** Alacritty + Tmux multiplexer

My general goal is to be productive on my day-to-day routine, and automate
everything that can actually be automated so that I can focus on higher-level
tasks that I'm interested in. I admit that sometimes I'm overdoing it and
automate a task that I don't actually actually have to but all in all I think
this attitude has helped me considerably so far.

I'm also a big believer in open-source; I'm striving to publish all my coding
projects on Github (see my [pinned repos](https://github.com/bergercookie) for
some of the works that I'm proud of) and I've also been mentoring for the past
two years for the [Google Summer of Code
Project](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) with the [MRPT robotics
organisation](https://mrpt.org). Thus, I'm trying to use as much as possible to
use open-source alternatives for any tasks 


Let me elaborate on the bullets above.

## Vim

## Unix Tools
