title: Scratchpad - LSD - A colorful ls alternative

![lsd demo](/images/lsd-demo.png)

[lsd](https://github.com/Peltoche/lsd) is an alternative to the classic ``ls`` UNIX tool. It shows you a listing of
files, directories, links, named pipes etc. The difference to its predecessor is
that it makes use of Glyph-rich fonts such as [Nerd
Fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) as well as an abundance of
colors preconfigured and available from start.

### Common Issues

* You're getting "Permission denied" when root or a ``$LD_PRELOAD`` error on a
  ``gtk3``-related library

  You've probably installed lsd via ``snap``. Don't; Either build it from source or
  install it with `apt`.

* Use lsd and redirect its output

    You might notice that when redirecting lsd output to e.g., a file, lsd
    detects that its output is not actually a terminal and turns off coloring
    and glyphs. Most of the time that's the correct behavior, otherwise it would
    pollute the output file with escape characters for the colors. However if
    you still want to keep colors and glyphs on, here's how you would do it

    {{< highlight bash >}}
    ls --tree --icon always --color always | less -r
    # Or if piping to a file
    ls --tree --icon always --color always | tee -a output-file
    {{< / highlight >}}
