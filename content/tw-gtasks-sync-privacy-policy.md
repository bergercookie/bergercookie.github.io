# Privacy Policy

I, Nikos Koukis, built the "Taskwarrior - GTasks Sync" as an Open Source app.
This SERVICE is provided by Nikos Koukis at no cost and is intended for use as
is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection,
use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.

## Information Collection and Use

I do not collect any information when you are using "Taskwarrior - GTasks
Sync". The purpose of this app is to synchronise your Taskwarrior tasks
on your local machine with your Google calendar events and is limited to that
particular use.

I do use the
[google-api-python-client](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-python-client)
client however in order to sync your Taskwarrior tasks with your Google Tasks
account and I do not know what data Google collects via that tool and when using
its Google Tasks API. You can find out more about Google's Privacy policy
though at this link:

https://policies.google.com/privacy

## Google API Scopes

This app needs access to your **Google Tasks** so that it can add, remove,
and update individual tasks to synchronise the corresponding **Google Tasks**
list with your local Taskwarrior configuration. Be advised that "Taskwarrior -
GTasks Sync" is not thoroughly tested and may contain bugs which could
result in data loss in your Google Tasks lists. You are advised to use a
dedicated Google Tasks list, different to your personal one. Remember that you
are using "Taskwarrior - GTasks Sync" at your own risk.

You can read more on how it works, or look at the source code
[here](https://github.com/bergercookie/syncall)

## Security

When using "Taskwarrior - GTasks Sync" to sync Taskwarrior tasks with Google
Calendar events you are using
[google-auth-oauthlib](https://pypi.org/project/google-auth-oauthlib/) to handle
the `OAuth` authentication and
[google-api-python-client](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-python-client),
and to communicate with the Google Tasks API and make changes to your
personal Google Tasks lists. The security of using this application is as strong
as the security of these two packages. Remember though that no method of
transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure
and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to
review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes
by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

This policy is effective as of 2023-23-12
