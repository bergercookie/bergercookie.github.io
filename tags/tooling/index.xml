<p>This post outlines 5 common issues that I had been facing during my day-to-day
development and the solutions that I came up with via 5 Albert plugins
respectively.</p>
<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>The purpose of these plugins is a) to avoid context-switching and b) have a
single tool with a single interface instead X different tools with their own
corresponding interfaces.</p>
<p>All are hosted under the same github repo:
<a href="https://github.com/bergercookie/awesome-albert-plugins">awesome-albert-plugins</a>
on github and here are links to each one of the plugins that I&rsquo;ll be discussing
below:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bergercookie/awesome-albert-plugins/tree/master/plugins/tldr_pages">TLDR pages</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bergercookie/awesome-albert-plugins/tree/master/plugins/scratchpad">Scratchpad</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bergercookie/awesome-albert-plugins#plugins">Googler-enabled plugins</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bergercookie/awesome-albert-plugins/tree/master/plugins/google_translate">google_translate</a> | <a href="https://github.com/bergercookie/awesome-albert-plugins/tree/master/plugins/words">words</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bergercookie/awesome-albert-plugins/tree/master/plugins/saxophone">Saxophone</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-looking-up-command--tool-usage-instructions">🔎 Looking up command / tool usage instructions</h2>
<p>During your daily routine, you&rsquo;ll want to look up how to call a certain tool,
say recursively compress the contents of a directory using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bzip2">bzip</a>, or create a new virtual environment
to work in using <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">Poetry</a>. You may either haven&rsquo;t
used these tools at all, or are not able to recall the exact flags for the task
at hand. Two common ways of dealing with this are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google it! You&rsquo;ll then most probably want to move to a stackoverflow answer,
copy-paste a command that seems to solve your issue, and then adjust it
accordingly. This involves a few browser redirections (at least <code>google.com</code>
-&gt; <code>stackoverflow.com</code>), as well as the overhead of selecting the right post
and finding the right answer to your question.</li>
<li>Read the manpage / help page of the tool, if it has one. This resource may be
more rigorous but it will also take more time to find the documentation section
that you&rsquo;re interested in.</li>
</ul>
<p>A more effective approach to this would be to use a software such as
<a href="https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr">tldr</a>, <a href="http://bropages.org/">bro pages</a>,
or <a href="https://github.com/cheat/cheat">cheat</a>. More specifically, <code>tldr</code> allows
you to look up the most common usecases for a wide variety of tools, all without
leaving your command line. It&rsquo;s also easily extensible, allowing you to add more
examples to specific tools, or adding documentation and examples for new tools.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/images/albert-demos2/tldr.svg" alt="tldr"  />
</p>
<p>However even in this case you have to switch context from what you&rsquo;re currently
doing; If you&rsquo;re working e.g., on VS Code, you have to start a new terminal,
look up the tool that you want, copy the usecase that you&rsquo;re interested in,
paste and modify it accordingly. We can do better than that.</p>
<p>Enter the <a href="https://github.com/bergercookie/awesome-albert-plugins/tree/master/plugins/tldr_pages">tldr_pages albert
plugin</a></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/images/albert-demos2/tldr-albert.gif" alt="tldr-pages-albert"  />
</p>
<p>It allows you to do fuzzy autocompletion-enabled search on any tldr command and
copy its content on ENTER. In addition you can also quickly navigate to the
appropriate webpage if you want to read more about the tool at hand, or fall
back to a google search if that&rsquo;s not good enough.</p>
<h2 id="-taking-notes-instantly---refactor-later">📓 Taking notes instantly - Refactor later</h2>
<p>Whether I&rsquo;m either reading articles on Wikipedia, watching videos on YouTube, or
doing pretty much anything on the computer that involves a bit of learning, I
like to take notes. A good approach to this would be to split your screen
vertically and have the browser on one side and your favorite editor on the
other. Then you would create a new text file for every new item you &rsquo;re
studying, add a title, then add your notes or copy paste accordingly.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/images/albert-demos2/scratchpad1.png" alt="scratchpad1"  />
</p>
<p>This involves a few steps in the process that can be improved:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>At that particular moment I don&rsquo;t want to have to:</p>
<ul>
<li>create a new file</li>
<li>think of where to place it in my hierarchy of notes</li>
<li>add the appropriate title</li>
<li>add structure to the note that I&rsquo;m taking</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather spend this time just recording my thoughts and reading through the
actual Wikipedia page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to switch between reading the resource and recording my notes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To deal with this, I&rsquo;m using a very simple plugin called <code>scratchpad</code>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/images/albert-demos2/scratchpad2.png" alt="scratchpad2"  />
</p>
<p>Its logic is super simple. You write some text to it and it writes it to a file;
The same file all the time. You specify the path to that file the first time you
trigger the plugin.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/images/albert-demos2/scratchpad3.png" alt="scratchpad3"  />
</p>
<p>Each text is saved there and by default it&rsquo;s formatted with a maximum width of
80 characters to assist in later potential reformatting. A blank line is
inserted between successive entries to the file and it allows to add a separator
if you start adding notes about a new subject</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/images/albert-demos2/scratchpad3.png" alt="scratchpad3"  />
</p>
<p>The plugin gets triggered either explicitly using <code>s&lt;space&gt;</code> or automatically
if your Albert query is longer than 5 words. This process allows you to record
anything you want and then sort them out later (i.e., place them into separate
files, structure them better, etc.).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/images/albert-demos2/scratchpad4.png" alt="scratchpad4"  />
</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how your scratchpad looks like after a bunch of additions from two
different pages:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/images/albert-demos2/scratchpad-final-result.png" alt="scratchpad-final-result"  />
</p>
<h2 id="-adding-links-during-text-editing">🔗 Adding Links during Text Editing</h2>
<p>Another common issue is inserting links to other pages or documentation while
you&rsquo;re creating or editing an existing page. That may be a markdown document for
your GitHub repo, a Confluence page or Jira issue in your day job or a report
you&rsquo;re righting in LibreOffice. Most times you&rsquo;d have to stop what you&rsquo;re doing,
launch your browser, search on google the thing you&rsquo;re interested in and
navigate to it, and finally, copy the link displayed in your browser prompt</p>
<p>Again, as with the previous issues discussed this approach takes too much time
<em>and</em> makes you context switch from the thing you&rsquo;re currently doing.</p>
<p>Instead use <a href="https://github.com/jarun/googler">googler</a> or even better one of
the many googler-enabled plugins in the
<a href="https://github.com/bergercookie/awesome-albert-plugins">awesome-albert-plugins</a>
repo. You can basically use the
<a href="https://github.com/bergercookie/awesome-albert-plugins/blob/master/create_googler_plugins.py">create_googler_plugins.py</a>
script after you&rsquo;ve downloaded the repository to several Albert plugins, each
one responsible for searching in a single website. So for example, you can use
the trigger <code>gg</code> to search and get results for Google, or <code>gh</code> to search on
GitHub or <code>imdb</code> to search on IMDB.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how it looks:</p>
<p>| <img loading="lazy" src="/images/albert-demos2/albert-suggestions-demo.gif" alt=""  />
 | <img loading="lazy" src="/images/albert-demos2/albert-suggestions-demo2.gif" alt=""  />
 |
| <img loading="lazy" src="/images/albert-demos2/albert-suggestions-demo3.gif" alt=""  />
 | <img loading="lazy" src="/images/albert-demos2/search_plugins.png" alt=""  />
 |</p>
<p>Using one of these plugins, for example the one that searches on Google, you can
search for and copy the link to the resource you&rsquo;re interested in without
leaving the document you&rsquo;re currently editing.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/images/albert-demos2/search-results.png" alt=""  />
</p>
<h2 id="-translating-text">🈯 Translating Text</h2>
<p>Again, same premise as in the previous cases. You&rsquo;re reading an article or
watching a movie and you don&rsquo;t know a word or a phrase written there. It&rsquo;s too
much of a hassle to open a new browser tab, go to Google Translate to do the
translation.</p>
<p>Use the <code>google_translate</code> plugin in conjunction with the <code>word</code> plugin.</p>
<p>| <img loading="lazy" src="/images/albert-demos2/google_translate.png" alt=""  />
 | <img loading="lazy" src="/images/albert-demos2/word.png" alt=""  />
 |</p>
<p>The <code>google_translate</code> plugin will translate the word from the source language
to the destination language while you can also use the <code>auto</code> source to enable
autodetection.</p>
<p>The <code>word</code> plugin on the other hand will give you the definition of the given
word along with synonyms and antonyms.</p>
<h2 id="-playing-radio-streams">🎷 Playing Radio Streams</h2>
<p>This last plugin allows you to play and alternate between different stations
easily and without jumping around different webpages to do so.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called <code>saxophone</code>, and this is how its interface looks.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/images/albert-demos2/saxophone.png" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of preconfigured radios, specified in the
<code>config/saxophone.json</code> file. You can easily extend that list to include your
preferences as well.</p>
<p>Under the hood it uses the <a href="https://wiki.videolan.org/documentation:modules/rc/">VLC Remote-Control
Interface</a>.</p>

<a href="https://albertlauncher.github.io/">Albert</a> launcher for many parts of my daily
routine.
For those of you that don&rsquo;t know it, Albert is an application launcher for
Linux. It&rsquo;s written in C++ and its GUI is built on top of Qt. The current post
is a short summary of the plugins I&rsquo;ve implemented to automate parts of my
current routine and maximise my productivity along with advise and, hopefully,
useful information on how to do the same for your needs via Albert.</p>
<p>If you want to extend Albert&rsquo;s capabilities you basically have two options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement a native Albert plugin in C++. For this you have to clone the
Albert repository, implement and compile your plugin along with the overall
repo.</li>
<li>Alternatively you can write a <a href="https://albertlauncher.github.io/docs/extensions/python/">python
extension</a>. The
latter can be developed separately from the main Albert repo and can be
enabled/disabled via an option in the application settings. This goes
without saying that, if you&rsquo;re comfortable with Python and you&rsquo;re willing to
sacrifice a tiny bit of performance when the plugin is running, then this
should be your go-to choice.</li>
</ul>
<p>In my case, I followed the latter approach and in the last ~3 months I implemented a
series of plugins to automate parts of my daily routine. All the plugins as well
as the overall content of this article can be found in the
<a href="https://github.com/bergercookie/awesome-albert-plugins">awesome-albert-plugins
repo</a>. Following is a
list of the plugins I implemented, along with a short description of what each
plugin does:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">Jira</a>: Mark tickets as in-progress/under-code-review/done, do fuzzy search on
their title, navigate to the corresponding ticket page</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://taskwarrior.org/">Taskwarrior</a>: Interact with taskwarrior - fuzzy search on title, change status
of task</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.zoopla.co.uk/">Zoopla</a> - Search Property to Buy, Rent, House Prices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://xkcd.com/">Xkcd</a> - Fetch xkcd comics  - do fuzzy search on title</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://maps.google.com">Google Maps</a> - Fetch instructions from/to a specific place, optionally via
specific transportation means</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suggestions-enabled search for various websites using
<a href="https://github.com/jarun/googler">googler</a>. For example:</p>
<p>Google
Amazon
Youtube
Github
Ebay
IMDB
&hellip;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some demo pictures of these plugins:</p>

<p>Since I spent a good deal of time writing these plugins, I figured I could share
some of my conclusions, shortcuts into writing a new plugin for your own
usecases:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use <a href="https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">cookiecutter</a> to minimise
the boilerplate code for your new plugin. The former uses the
<a href="https://www.palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/">Jinja</a> templating language to
substitute placeholder values in the contents of files and in the names of the
files and directories.
Here&rsquo;s the <a href="https://github.com/bergercookie/awesome-albert-plugins/tree/master/cookiecutter">cookiecutter
package</a>
layout that I have been using for spawning new Albert plugins:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span style="display:flex;"><span>    cookiecutter/

<p>Give the user an easy way of raising issues and bugs</p>
<p>When using an albert plugin (or a general-purpose python script) many things
can go wrong at runtime (HTTP connection errors, filesystem errors etc.).
Moreover, the potential plugin user may be running albert on the background,
without having access to the corresponding pseudoterminal it was launched
from. This is why, in case of an error, the plugin will silently fail. Here&rsquo;s
a snippet of code that I&rsquo;ve been using so that errors are not left unnoticed
as well as an easy way for the user to report the bug:</p>

<p>Now, in case an exception is raised during runtime, the user is greeted with
the following message:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/images/albet-plugin-error-msg.png" alt="albert-error-message"  />

<p>And when pressing ENTER, the appropriate ISSUES page URL is copied to the

<p>Have a setup phase for checking that all the requirements for your plugin are
in place</p>
<p>In case more setup steps are required (e.g., login credentials)  that can
happen as part of the first albert plugin run(s). In my case, I&rsquo;ve been using
a <code>setup</code> function called at the start of the plugin that checks that all the
requirements are in-place before actually going through the main plugin
functionality. Here&rsquo;s a sample of how the setup phase works for the JIRA
plugin:</p>

<p>Thus, in this case, on the fist run, the user will have to write their
username and server on the albert prompt, which will be saved in appropriate
files, and in the following 2 plugin runs, the plugin will check that their
password and API key can be appropriately found using the Pass
password manager.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give the user an easy way of installing the plugin.</p>
<p>Along with each new albert plugin, I&rsquo;ve been adding (again generating it via
cookiecutter) an <code>install-plugin.sh</code> script that sets up all the plugin
dependencies via either the system package manager (e.g., <code>apt-get</code>) or the
language package manager
(i.e., <code>pip</code>) and also copies the plugin directory to the local albert modules
installation, i.e.: <code>~/.local/share/albert/org.albert.extension.python/</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That&rsquo;s all for now. Let me know if this has been helpful or has given you any
inspiration for making your own extensions.</p>

fun of, tooling. More specifically I want to describe my workflow when working
or in general when using my machine.</p>
<p>My general goal is to be productive in my day-to-day routine, and automate
everything that can actually be automated so that I can focus on the
higher-level tasks I&rsquo;m interested in. I admit that sometimes I&rsquo;m overdoing it
and automate a task that I don&rsquo;t actually have to but all in all I think this
attitude has helped me considerably so far.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also a big believer in open-source. I&rsquo;m striving to publish all my coding
projects on Github (see my <a href="https://github.com/bergercookie">pinned repos</a> for
some of the works I&rsquo;m proud of) and I&rsquo;ve also been mentoring for the past two
years for the <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google Summer of Code Project</a> with the <a href="https://mrpt.org">MRPT robotics
organisation</a>. Thus, I&rsquo;m trying as much as possible to use
open-source alternatives for all my tasks. That being said, if there is a
paid-for tool that does something great I&rsquo;m happy to pay for it (e.g., see the
excellent <code>C/C++ Code Explorer</code> - <a href="https://www.sourcetrail.com/">Sourcetrail</a>).</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a bullet list of the software I&rsquo;m using:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>OS:</strong> GNU/Linux</li>
<li><strong>Linux flavour:</strong> Ubuntu/Debian</li>
<li><strong>Editor:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim">Vim/Neovim</a></li>
<li><strong>Browser:</strong> Firefox</li>
<li><strong>Terminal:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty">Alacritty</a> + <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux">Tmux multiplexer</a> + Bash</li>
<li><strong>Desktop Environment:</strong> <a href="https://i3wm.org/">i3</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Let me now elaborate on the bullets above.</p>
<h2 id="gnulinux---debian-flavours">GNU/Linux - Debian-flavours</h2>
<p>Linux is free, as in freedom, it&rsquo;s ubiquitous and is simply the bestest
operating system there is 😏. Regarding flavour, I simply use Debian or
Ubuntu as the main operating system just because I feel most comfortable in
these systems It&rsquo;s nice know how to open all sorts of files
(<code>xdg-open</code>/<code>xdg-mime</code>) search for package names (<code>apt-cache</code>) install packages
/ download sources (<code>apt-cache</code>, <code>apt-get</code>, <code>dpkg</code>) and in general know how your
system works. Also being a roboticist by profession, there is a strong
inclination towards <code>Debian</code> / <code>Ubuntu</code> since <a href="https://ros.org">ROS</a> (<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>)
ships binaries for specifically for these platforms and it&rsquo;s a total PITA to
compile it from source. Finally I consider it a big deal to always have a stable
system even if that means not compiling your project with the latest and
greatest gcc-8 compiler. Ubuntu and Debian give you that and also provide ways
of installing more recent versions (<a href="http://linuxbrew.sh/">linuxbrew</a>, <a href="https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+ppas">Ubuntu
PPAs</a>) and hey, you can always compile stuff
from source if the previous don&rsquo;t work for you 😉</p>
<h2 id="vimneovim">Vim/Neovim</h2>
<p>There is a gazillion of articles on how to use vim or what to put in your
<code>vimrc</code> so I&rsquo;m going to keep it short here.</p>
<p>Here are some of the plugins that I use on a daily basis and I&rsquo;m confident have
boosted my editing efficiency significantly. Refer to the corresponding
<code>README</code>s for more details:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plugin manager: <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug">vim-plug</a></li>
<li>Asynchronous syntax checking/linting: <a href="https://github.com/w0rp/ale">ale</a></li>
<li>Semantically-accurate syntax highlighting: <a href="https://github.com/arakashic/chromatica.nvim">chromatica</a></li>
<li>Indentation level detection: <a href="https://github.com/ciaranm/detectindent">detectindent</a></li>
<li>Git client: <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive">fugitive</a></li>
<li><code>Printf</code>-like code debugging (<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>): <a href="https://github.com/bergercookie/vim-debugstring">debugstring</a></li>
<li>UNIX helper functions: <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive">eunuch</a></li>
<li>Asynchronous fuzzy searching: <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim">fzf</a></li>
<li>Personal knowledge base /Task management: <a href="https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki">vimwiki</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tbabej/taskwiki">taskwiki</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The important thing to note here is that you have to find a combination that
works for you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t use more plugins than you actually need or you&rsquo;ll bloat vim and you&rsquo;ll
have awful startup times,</li>
<li>Double-check that adding the plugin is worth the maintenance cost / potential
startup overhead / effort to learn it. Maybe there&rsquo;s already has a way of
expressing it? Maybe it&rsquo;s just a matter of a single function in your <code>.vimrc</code>?</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, here&rsquo;s a link to my vim configuration in case you want to take a
better look: <a href="https://github.com/bergercookie/vim-dotfiles">vim-dotfiles</a></p>
<h2 id="firefox">Firefox</h2>
<p>Firefox is the de-facto open-source internet browser. It&rsquo;s fast, it&rsquo;s sleek and
using the new Firefox <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebExtensions">WebExtensions</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl">tridactyl</a> one can browse the web
like it&rsquo;s <code>Vim</code> (<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>).</p>
<h2 id="alacrittytmux">Alacritty/Tmux</h2>
<p><code>Alacritty</code> represents a newer trend in terminal emulators in that its objective
is to render the terminal output using the computer GPU. Other than that, its
developers strive to keep it minimal by <strong>not</strong> implementing additional features
such as preferences window GUI (everything is managed by a <code>YAML</code> file) multiple
tabs, split panes etc and instead keep it simple and fast. For most of the
functionality that&rsquo;s omitted (e.g., split panes), they advice the usage of a
tool designed for that such as &hellip; 🥁 Tmux!</p>
<p><code>Tmux</code> is the modern alternative to the good-old <code>screen</code> multiplexer. The big
difference compared to its predecessor is the good list of plugins and
customisation options it gives to its user. It comes with its own plugin manager
<a href="https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm">tpm</a> along with plugins such as
<a href="https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-yank">tmux-yank</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-continuum">tmux-continuum</a> , and
<a href="https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-resurrect">tmux-resurrect</a> which
significantly enhance the Tmux user experience.</p>
<p>Finally, I&rsquo;m using <code>Bash</code> for general navigation, system-interaction tasks. Bash
is the default Linux shell, and 99% of Linux machines you encounter will have
it. Yes, I am aware of <code>zsh</code> and the billion of plugins that it offers. In
general it is a superior shell compared to Bash but honestly the difference is
not big enough to counter for the fact that bash is ubiquitous and eventually
you&rsquo;ll be forced to used it when working on a new machine / someone else&rsquo;s
laptop.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my terminal configuration at the time of writing this:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/images/tmux-view.png" alt="tmux-view"  />
</p>
<h2 id="i3">i3</h2>
<p>i3 is a tiling window manager, meaning that it&rsquo;s designed for placing windows as
individual tiles in your screen(s). Since <code>Tmux</code> does most of the heavy-lifting in
the terminal (splitting to panes, multiple sessions, multiple named windows
etc.). <code>i3</code> gives you (almost) the configurability of a window manager such as
<a href="https://awesomewm.org/">awesome</a> but with much less hassle for configuring it
to reach a version that works.</p>
<p>I use i3 mainly for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Split apps into workspaces. Be able to navigate between workspaces and between
apps using only the mouse</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stacked views of windows</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automatic placement of a windowed app on startup/launch.</p>
<p>No more shoving windows around when you launch a program. It will
automatically take its place based on the corresponding workspace. You can
do it with simple rules in your i3 config file. For example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><div style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">
<table style="border-spacing:0;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;"><tr><td style="vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;">

<h2 id="miscellaneous-unix-related-tooling">Miscellaneous UNIX-related tooling</h2>
<p>This is a list of tools that didn&rsquo;t fit any of the previous categories but are
still worth mentioning:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Password management:</strong> <a href="https://www.passwordstore.org/">UNIX Password Pass</a></p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t emphasise how easy and intuitive password management has been it
since I came across <code>Pass</code>. It&rsquo;s a minimal tool built on top of well
established software such as <code>GPG</code> (for encryption) and <code>Git</code> for version
control. There is also a fully functional android app
<a href="https://github.com/zeapo/Android-Password-Store">PasswordStore</a> that syncs
via git so you can have all your passwords in all your devices and actually
reason on how the whole pipeline actually works.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>E-Book/Scientific works management:</strong> <a href="https://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a></p>
<p>Calibre is an open-source e-book management tool written in Python. Apart
from its obvious task, it can sync your books with Kindle or android devices
it can import and manage various formats (e.g., <code>pdf</code>, <code>mobi</code>), and it can
also has a pretty decent android client.</p>

<p>I know that Chrome also offers vim-like binding plugins but from my experience with them there&rsquo;s just a world of difference between those and Firefox plugins such as Tridactyl and its predecessors <code>Vimperator</code> / <code>Pentadactyl</code>.&#160;<a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
